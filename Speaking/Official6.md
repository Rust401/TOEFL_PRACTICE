**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university.Use specific reasons and details in your response.**

As for me, I agree with the statement that parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university. As for why, I supposed that's because children just graduated from the high school are generally not sophisticated enough to collect information comprehensively. And they often disjudge the priority of each conditions. For example, when my borther choose the university. He only took the prestige and conprehensive ranking into consideration. While with other situations, such as the loaction and the subject ranking, he didn't do any further analysis. And the result was that he enter a university with awesome prestige but the location is far from the reginal center so he had poor opportunities to find a internship. Based on the reasons above, I think parents should be involved in the process of helping their children to choose a university.

**The woman expresses her opinion about the universityâ€™s plan. Briefly summarize the plan, then state her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.**

replace the traditonal-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks

new feature->pay extra money upgrade the original machine
damaged -> buy new one

screen and button    too small-> not easy to operate     normal-sized-finger dude
prefer the traditional way hight text, underline, take notes
```

The univertity plans to relace the traditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year.The woman doesn't support the plan. First, she thinks that's not realistic for the cost issue since it will still cost the studetns a lot when they break their device or when they wish to get the device upgraded for some new features. Second, she says the device itself is not pratical too. She thinks the screen and the button of this machine is too small to operate smoothly even for a normal-sized-fingered student. She prefers the traditional way to highlight text,underline and take notes directly on the text book. In a nut shell, she doesn't support the plan.

**Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of swarm intelligence.**
```txt
complex group behavior
insects aggregate to finish a complex task together
swam intelligence

two branches -> two far
attach & stretch
one base another

->get the food
```  

The complex group behavior that insects living in a large group display to achieve a complex task together is called swarm intelligence. To illustrates that, the professor gave us an example of ants.A group ants manage to get the food on the other branch from the current branch. The gap between the two branches is too far for a single ant to achieve. So the first ant attaches itself to the end of the branch and then stretches its body to make the distance between the two branches smaller. Than the second ant does the same things based on the the current state. And at last the ants build a bridge between the two branches and manage to get the food. That's how swarm intelligence achieved.

**Briefly summarize the problem the professors are discussing. Then state which of the two solutions form the conversation you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.**
```txt
poetry class vs retirement party

cover class || arrrive after finishing

second

#first

irresponsible leave students behind
reviewing important 
need summarize
organize everthing
prepare for final


#second

different style
differet knowledge point

not wise review session
```

Well, the woman's had a problem with her schedule. Actually, her poetry class conflicts with her cousin's retirement party. There are two solutions for the woman's problem: she could let the man cover her class and lead the review session, or she could arrive late for the party after finishing her poetry class. Well, I guess the second solution is a better one for some reasons. First, it'll be irresponsible for the woman to leave her students behind and go to a party. Reviewing classes are so important that the students usually need a summarization from their teacher to organize everything for the whole course and to get prepared for their finals. Second, a new teacher who may probably teach in a different style and cover different knowledge points wouldn't be a wise choice for a replacement as a leader of the review session. So the woman, I guess, should follow the second solution of the problem.


**Using the examples from the lecture, explain two developments that allowed ancient Roman cities to expand.**
```txt
#new building materials

concrete harden under water->
build big bridge->
car wagons   transport equipment  || build large cities on both sides


#aqueducts   improve way to move fresh water

open channels
stretch from water sources (on the moutain)
-> provide plenty downflow water->can supply places far away from the river->
cities grows with no need to stick between river.

```


The first development is the use of new building materials, a special kind of concrete that hardens under water. And this technology allows ancient Romans to build large strong bridges over wide rivers so that cars and wagons can transport equipment and materials on it to create larger cities on both sides of the rivers. Another technology is an improved way to move fresh water, a structure called aqueducts. They're series of open channels that stretch from water sources high in the mountain down to the cities and provide steady flow of fresh water along with the steady drop of altitude. Since the aqueducts can provide plenty of fresh water, they can supply places, even those far away from the river with the fresh water. So cities could grow without having to be built nearby a river.
