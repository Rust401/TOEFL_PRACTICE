**Some people who unexpectedly receive a large amount of money spend it on practical things, while others spend it for pleasure only, which do you think is better and why?**

pratical:
* set up a fund for charity 
* help those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation
* building school for kids

pleasure:
* buy company
* buy house

I think spending money on pratical things is better. And it's not a wise way to spend money just for pleasure. As for why, I suppose that's because human desire is insatiable. If you buy a big house, there must be a bigger house. If you buy a big company, there must be a bigger company. So wiser people should spend money on some pratical things such as setting up a fund for charity, helping those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation, buidling scholl for kids who live in the rural areas and so on. Besides, even opening a book store is better than just spend money for pleasure.


**The man expresses his opinion about the student’s suggestions that are made in the letter. State the man’s opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.** 

The man doesn't support the student's suggestions to add more doctors and keep the health center open on weekend. First, he thinks hiring more doctors won't solve the problem. The health center is lack of space. So unless the school renovate the health center and provides more facilities and rooms, the capacity of the health center to handle the patient will not increase. Second, he said opending the health center on weekend won't solve the problem. Most people especially students are generally away on weekends. There are not so many patients in urgent need of seeing a doctor. Opening the health center on weekend is dispensible(make no point at all). So the man disagree the suggestions in the letter.


**Using the example from the lecture, explain what social loafing is, and how it affects behavior.**
Social loafing is a phenomenon that when people work in a task conducted by group and their personal accomplishment will not be recorded precisely, they tend to work not that hard. There is a experiment. Paticipator are divide into two categories to peel the potatoes as much as possible with a given amount of time. People in category one are told to peel the potatoes on their own and each potatoe they peeled will be recorded. People in another category are told to peal the potatoes together but only the total number of the potaotes peeled will be recorded. Each group member will only get an average number of potatoes pealed as their score. The result is that the people peal the potatoes on their own tend to peal much more. This is the example of social loafing and it will impact the efficiency of group work. 


The phenomenon that an individual tends to decrease his/her effort in a task conducted by a group is called social loafing. According to the professor, a study was done to illustrate the phenomenon. In the study, some people were asked to peel as many  potatoes as possible within a given amount of time. Some of them worked alone, and they were told that the number of potatoes that each of them had peeled would be recorded. Others worked in a group and were told that only the total number of potatoes would be recorded, and there was no counting of how many each individual had peeled. When the results were compared, the researcher discovered that the individuals in a group peeled much less potatoes than those working alone. So this study suggests that when in a group, people are likely to contribute less since they don't think they're directly responsible for the task.
