**Some people who unexpectedly receive a large amount of money spend it on practical things, while others spend it for pleasure only, which do you think is better and why?**

pratical:
* set up a fund for charity 
* help those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation
* building school for kids

pleasure:
* buy company
* buy house

I think spending money on pratical things is better. And it's not a wise way to spend money just for pleasure. As for why, I suppose that's because human desire is insatiable. If you buy a big house, there must be a bigger house. If you buy a big company, there must be a bigger company. So wiser people should spend money on some pratical things such as setting up a fund for charity, helping those who are in urgent need of food and sanitation, buidling scholl for kids who live in the rural areas and so on. Besides, even opening a book store is better than just spend money for pleasure.


**The man expresses his opinion about the student’s suggestions that are made in the letter. State the man’s opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.** 

The man doesn't support the student's suggestions to add more doctors and keep the health center open on weekend. First, he thinks hiring more doctors won't solve the problem. The health center is lack of space. So unless the school renovate the health center and provides more facilities and rooms, the capacity of the health center to handle the patient will not increase. Second, he said opending the health center on weekend won't solve the problem. Most people especially students are generally away on weekends. There are not so many patients in urgent need of seeing a doctor. Opening the health center on weekend is dispensible(make no point at all). So the man disagree the suggestions in the letter.


**Using the example from the lecture, explain what social loafing is, and how it affects behavior.**
Social loafing is a phenomenon that when people work in a task conducted by group and their personal accomplishment will not be recorded precisely, they tend to work not that hard. There is a experiment. Paticipator are divide into two categories to peel the potatoes as much as possible with a given amount of time. People in category one are told to peel the potatoes on their own and each potatoe they peeled will be recorded. People in another category are told to peal the potatoes together but only the total number of the potaotes peeled will be recorded. Each group member will only get an average number of potatoes pealed as their score. The result is that the people peal the potatoes on their own tend to peal much more. This is the example of social loafing and it will impact the efficiency of group work. 


The phenomenon that an individual tends to decrease his/her effort in a task conducted by a group is called social loafing. According to the professor, a study was done to illustrate the phenomenon. In the study, some people were asked to peel as many  potatoes as possible within a given amount of time. Some of them worked alone, and they were told that the number of potatoes that each of them had peeled would be recorded. Others worked in a group and were told that only the total number of potatoes would be recorded, and there was no counting of how many each individual had peeled. When the results were compared, the researcher discovered that the individuals in a group peeled much less potatoes than those working alone. So this study suggests that when in a group, people are likely to contribute less since they don't think they're directly responsible for the task.


**The students discuss two possible solutions to the man’s problem. Briefly summarize the problem, then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why.**

The man can't get the book directly from the libarary until two weeks later. He has two choices. The first is to make a rush order online although double-priced rush order is rather expensive. The second choice is to share the book with the wowen. I prefer the first one, to make a rush order. There are two reasons. First, long-term sharing is annoyed. They tend to spend a lot of time deliver the book back-and-forth. The owener of the book may be unpleasent because sometimes she has to stop her own reading and borrows the book to the man to cover the deadline. Second, it's not convenient for two dudes to take notes on the same book. There notes may take too much space and confict with each other. So I prefer the man to buy his own book though the delivery fee is expensible. That will eliminate unneccessary trouble. In a nut shell, I prefer the first solution.

Well, the man's problem is that he needs to read a book for the class discussion but he could get a copy. Accordingly there're two solutions for the man: he could place a rush order online or he could share the woman's copy. I think the man should share the woman's copy simply because the double-priced rush order is way too expensive. Besides, to share reading always means sharing thoughts and sometimes inspirations come out. By careful schedule and regular meetings, the man and the woman could have enough time to discuss and share ideas and insights together, which will be perfect preparation for their discussion in class. In a nut shell, I prefer the second solution for the man.


**Using points and examples from the talk explain internal and external locus of control.**

Internal locus of control means people who think the result of one thing depend on his/her own effert. Take the job interview for example. If a woman with internal locus of control prepares for a job, she will do as much as they can to prepare for the interview ahead of time. If she get the job, she will think that's the result of her own effort. If he fails the interview, she will be very upset cuz she think it's her own fault to miss some key point and she will work harder to prepare more for the next time. People with external locus of control is quite the opposite. The person with it believes in the decisive role of external forces. For example, a man with external locus of control will attribute his success of a job interview to the interviews's good mood and luck rather than his own effort. And if he fails he will blame his failure for bad luck or the interviews' bad mood instead of his own problem. And he won't try to improve himself for the next time.



Internal locus of control means the belief that the control comes from oneself rather than external force, and thus the person who has it will attribute their success to their personal effort. For example, if a woman with internal locus of control goes to a job interview, she'll work very hard to prepare for the interview ahead of time. If she gets the job, she'll attribute it all to her own effort. But if she doesn't, she may be upset about herself and try to figure out why she fails and how to improve the next time. However, external locus of control is different. The person with it believes in the decisive role of external forces. For example, a man with external locus of control will attribute his success of a job interview to the interviewer's good mood and luck rather than his own effort, or blame his failure for bad luck or the interviewers instead of his own problem. And he won't even try to improve himself for the next time.
