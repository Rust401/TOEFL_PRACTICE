The reading passage and lecture hold `different` opinions regarding the reason `why animal play`. The reading passage proposes three theories to explain `such behavior`, which are `contradicted` by the following lecture.

First, according to the reading, `the animals have to play to get rid of  the surplus energy that they have not used`. The listening, however, argues that such explanation is weakend by the fact that `certain marine mamals, such as seals, still play when they are waiting for food when their parents are hunting. At this time there is no energy input for them.`

Second, according to the reading, `the animals have to play to practice physical actions they nedd for survival. It states that young aninals play as part of their physical education.` The listening, however, argues that such explanation is weakend by an experiment. `There are two groups of cats, one group is permit to play and another is not allowed to play. But when they grow up, the hunting skills between the two groups have no difference.`

The third theory in the reading is called the `social fucntions theory,` claim that `play gives animals a chance to bond with the other member in their group.`  Yet the listening opposes, claiming that `play is not necessary for aninals to bond with other member.` That's because that `rats only play when they are very young, but they still need to develope their social abilities when they stop playing anymore.`

The reading passage and lecture hold `different` opinions regarding the `solutions to help the American bats to resist the fungus`. The reading passage propose three `solutions to resist the fungul infections of bats` which are refuted by the following lecture.

First, according to the reading, `people should stay away from the caves where bats sleep in the winter because scientists believe that fungus likely spreads from cave to cave by riding on peopleâ€™s clothes.` The listening, however, argues that `fungus are spread mainly by bats. The claim is supported by the fact that some caves where people have not been to were also found to be infected.`

Second, according to the reading, `we should research a species of bats in Europe in order to find the reason why they have resistence to such disease, so that American bats can be saved`. The reading, however, argues that `such research leads to no practial help as the resistence develope from a long-time biological adaptation`. `And it may take decades to find the cure. And before that, the rapid-spreading disease may kill all the American`.

The third solution in the reading is to `heat the cave to disturb the reproduction of the fungus because they can only grow in the temperature around 4 celsius.` Yet the listening opposes, claming that `heating the cave will disturb the bats' sleep because they will feel that it's the summer. They will wake up and starve to death.`

The reading passage the the lecture hold different opininons regrading what the short-faced bear eat to sustain its massive body size. The reading passage proposes three theories which are refuted by the following lecture.

First, according to the reading, short-faced bears may eat extremely large mammals include giant species of buffalo and elephant-like mammoths because their massive front legs and feet would have allowed it to attack giant mammals by pulling them to the ground. The listening, however, argues that the new discovered skeleton of short-faced bear show that their bones are thin. So they are too weak to pull the large mammals down to the ground.

Second, according to the reading, these bears may eat fast-running animals such as deer and antelope. The skeletons of them indicate that they had unusually long legs that would have allowed them to attain running speeds as fast as 65 kilometers per hous which give them the ability to chase down these fast-moving prey animals. The reading,however, argues that fast-moving animals usually not run in straight line, they tend to change their direction when they are runnning. But it's difficult for short-faced bear to change speed and direction in the running state so it's hard for them to follow the fast-running animals.

The third theories in the reading is that short-faced bears are scavenger and eat aninals have already been killed by other animal because their giant size allowed them to frighten or fight off predators. Yet the listening opposes, claiming that there are no characteristic markings usually found on the teeth of scavengers on their teeth. The scavengers have such marks because they have to chew the hard bones of the partially eaten animals. The final theory is thus disproved.
