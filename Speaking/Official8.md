**Some people say that childhood is the best time in a person's life. Other people disagree. What is your opinion? Explain why.**


```txt
childhood is the best time in a person's life
care-free phase throughout one's life

first
taken care of by both the parents and grandparents
->
don't have to worry about     how to make a living
free from stress or anxiety not the breadwinner

second
enjoy pure(pristine and sincere friendship)  little buddies  live next door to you(nearby)
less competition comparison peer pressure   among little kids
loved cherished pampered

peaceful and joyful   not bothered by trival or mundane things  
keep bugging adolescents and adults
```


In my eyes, childhood is indeed the best period of time in one's life. Being a kid is probably the most care-free phase throughout one's life. On the one hand, you are taken good care of by both your parents and grandparents, so you don't have to worry about how to make a living. You are free from stress or anxiety. After all, you are not the breadwinner. On the other hand, you enjoy your pure and sincere friendship with your little buddies who perhaps live just next door to you. There is much less competition, comparison or peer pressure among little kids. So you are loved, cherished, or even pampered. Childhood really seems like a peaceful and joyful time where you are not bothered by the trivial or mundane things that keep bugging adolescents and adults.


**When some people have a little extra money, they like to spend it right away on something they enjoy. Others prefer to save the extra money. Which do you like to do? Explain why.**

```txt
have a little extra money -> try to save the extra money
promise life standard even though I have a big cost

example:
before marriage:
spend salary for fun
love traveling   ->  plan 3-4  trips a year
but considered buying a house - > get into marrige
found nothing from my bank savings-> I felt myself in total despair -> loaned a lot of money from the bank

after loan:
life changed
work hard  cut all my traveling plan
save every extra penny for savings

That's a painful experience
```

I will definitely save it up, because this money could promise my life standard even though I will have a big cost. For example, before my marriage, I used to spend all of my salary for fun. I love traveling so usually I planned 3 or 4 trips a year. But, when one day I considered buying my own apartment and getting into marriage, I found nothing from my bank savings. I felt myself in total despair. So I loaned a lot of money from the bank. And ever since then, my life changed. I began to work very hard, cut all my travel plans, and save every extra penny for my savings. What a painful experience!

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Eighteen-year-olds are not mature enough to vote. Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.**

```txt
agree
not big enough to collect information sophisticatedlly
no ablity to analysis situation comprehensively
example
When I graduated from high school
tangled to make a decision to choose a university
take prestige and comprehensive ranking into consideration
neglect the truth it's far from the regional center
hard for me to find an internship

hard for me to choose a university, not to mention the voting
```

```txt
campaign
make propaganda videos -> trustworthy reliable public image
in this material
have some made-up information  -> mislead and attract potential voters(who know nothing of what the true story is)
this trick could happen to adults   not to mention those eighteen-year-old youth
unwise to allow 18 to vote    better approch    get older more mature    like 24-year-old
```

During a campaign, many candidates may make a lot of propaganda videos to create a trustworthy and reliable public image. However, in these materials, it may have some made-up information which is used to mislead and attract potential voters, who know nothing of what the true story is. If this trick could happen to adults, not to mention those eighteen-year-old youth. Therefore, it is unwise to allow eighteen-year-olds to vote and a better approach would be to let them vote when they get older and more mature, like 24-year-old or something.


**Some people like having a wide variety of friends and acquaintances they can spend time with. Others like to spend most of their free time with the same small group of close friends. Which do you prefer? Explain why.**

```txt
depend on motive   behind making friends (target)

self-improve:
wide variety of friends and acquaintances    
access wider and diverse social network 
make progress in various aspects
older people     offer the wisdom   of  life experience

nevertheless

vent emotions
a small and close group of friends
being with close buddies
be yourself and don't have to care too much about what you say and do
things your express and convey wouldn' hurt any pratical interest 
way to relief and relaxation

therefore, to be with which sort of friends is up to your true need
```


This is a quite complicated question. It really depends on the very motive behind your making friends. If you want to improve yourself, it is much better to get in touch with a wide range of friends and acquaintances because by having access to a wider and more diverse social network, you could make progress in various aspects, like you may be capable of meeting people who are older than you and they could offer you the wisdom of their life experience. Nevertheless, if you would love to vent your emotions, a small and closer friend is always a better choice. When being in front of your close buddies, you just can be yourself and don’t have to care too much about what you say and do. Everything that you express and convey wouldn’t hurt any of your practical interest. It’s just a way of relief and relaxation. Therefore, to be with which sort of friends is up to your true need.


**Some teachers think that it is important for students to sit in assigned seats, that is, to sit in the same place every day in class.Other teachers think that students should be allowed to choose where they will sit, and they allow them to sit in different seats on different days.Which do you think is better? Explain why.**

```txt
student should be allowed to choose where they will sit

first:
have discussion conveniently with other group members   focusing on the same projects
proximity do facilitate this kind of discussion

second:
enable students     establish relationship with more people in the same class
fixed seat -> social connection    confined to   those around him
typical case:
    nephew who was assigned to sit in the front row in high school->could not name those sat in the back row after one semester

```
From my perspective, I prefer the latter option. One obvious advantage of it is that students are able to have discussions conveniently with other group members who are focusing on the same projects. Proximity do facilitate this kind of discussions. Also, it may enable students to establish relationship with more people in the same class. If the seat is fixed, a student’s social connection is very likely to be confined to those around him. A typical case of it is that my nephew who was assigned to sit in the front row in high school, could not even name those sat in the back row after one semester. 


**Some people like to shop in large grocery stores and department stores. Other people prefer to shop in small specialty stores or shops. Which do you prefer? Explain why.**

```txt
prefer large grocery stores and department stores
first:
    things in my target list can be purchased
    good place to buy computers, routers, switches and cables at the same time

second:
    other entertainment facilities can be offered
    bored||tired  ->  go to cafeteria or resutaurant  -> treat ourself with a movie afterwards
```


I favor department stores more than those small specialty stores. One reason is that anything I want can be purchased from large grocery stores, so it is an ideal place for me to buy dresses, tops, shorts, bags and shoes at the same time. Another reason is that other entertainment facilities can also be offered by large grocery stores. When I get bored and tired, my parents or friends can go to café or restaurant and treat ourselves with a movie afterwards.


**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?In the future, people will read fewer books than they do toady.Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.**

```txt
rapid pace of life -> allows less time for employees to immerse themselves in a wide range of books

various entertainments   video games   TV shows    outdoor activities   distract people from focusing on study   
```

I believe that people in the future will read fewer books than they do in the present. One obvious reason is that the rapid pace of life allows less time for employees to immerse themselves in a wide range of books. Another reason is that various entertainments such as video games, soap operas and outdoor activities will distract people from focusing on studying, even when they are in library. 


**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?People today have healthier lifestyles than people did 100 years ago.Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.**

```txt
agree 
first:

    find it necessrary to keep a balance between life and work

second:
    traveling to different place when they are free
    living standard increased tremendously   enjoy life to a large extent

```

Yes, I agree with the statement for the following reasons. Firstly, People attach greater importance to their health than 100 years ago. Since people are busy with their jobs, they find it necessary to keep a balance between life and work. Secondly, people like travelling to different places when they are free. Because people’s living standards have increased tremendously, they would like to enjoy life to a great extent. These are the reasons why I think people today have healthier lifestyles than 100 years ago.

`Actually, I found that the quality of the recent solutions is not that good. First, these solutions lack the example the support the arguments. In the former cases, every arguement supproting the statement will attain a example to depict the the details. And these example can make the arguments more powerful and more persuasive. Second, the arguments in the current solutions are just not related with the main idea. They can barely support the main idea. The solutions just put some sentences on the answer boxes, with some keyword seemly have relationship with the topic. In fact, this is a bunch of gabbage.`

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Artists and musicians are important to a society.Use details and examples to explain your answer.**

```txt
make the society more colorful    enriching the variety of culture
benefit a lot from the works of artists and musicians

preoccupied with work and study    confronted overwhelming pressure
get relaxation better foucus on future study and work to a large extent

```

Yes, I agree with the statement that artists and musicians are significant to a society. My reasons are as follows. Firstly, artists and musicians can make the society more colorful by enriching the variety of culture. Secondly, people can benefit a lot from the works of artists and musicians. For example, they can draw some pictures or listen to some favorite music to have a good relaxation after a day’s hardwork.


**Some people believe that primary schools should no longer teach children how to write by hand, and instead should spend time teaching them how to type on a computer. Other people believe that it is still important for schools to teach children to have good handwriting. Which point of view do you agree with? Explain why.**

```txt
computer produce barriers to people's communication
first:
    writing things out by hand may be a critical way to train our brains
    Improve the perception of shape
    train the finger muscles so fingers can complete a series of fine movements
```

It is unquestionable that primary students should learn how to write by hand, as computer continues barriers to people’s communication in the society. Firstly, writing things out by hand may be a critical way we train our brains. What’s more, handwriting helps children learn letters and shapes, improves their composition of ideas, and may also boost fine-motor skills development. 


**Some students attend college full-time, while others attend college part-time. Which do you think is better? Explain why.**

```txt
definitely    attend college full-time is better
confused  some people expect to learn anything if they don't attend colleges for full time
first:
    Learning a course systematically is time-consuming. 
    need regular review to inscript the knowledge on the brain. occationally learning some course increases the time to build a knowledge structure. 
    In other words, it's inefficient.
second:
    miss important events and chances to make friends.
    inevitbale to lose the change to disscuss with the classmates to get comprehensive and profound understanding
    hard to keep the same pace with others
```


Some people may believe that they only attend college part-time, but I disagree. I don't understand how university students can expect to learn anything if they don't attend colleges for full-time. First, in college they gain the benefit of the professor's knowledge preferentially. The best professors do more than just go over the material in the textbooks. Also, attending colleges on any subject teaches more than just facts. It teaches students how to learn, how to absorb information and then apply what they've learned to other situations. Personal experience can help people learn about themselves and the world outside the classroom, but when it comes to learning about academic subjects, students need to be in college better for a longer time. At last, if you just attend college for part-time, then you will miss important events and chances to make friends. It is hard to keep the same pace with others. So, I will choose to attend college for full-time.


**Some people prefer living in a big city. Other people prefer living in the countryside, away from urban areas. Which do you think is better? Explain why, using specific details in your explanation.**

```
first
    healthier environment
    suffer air and water pollution  
    caused by high speeding development of industry
second
    slow pace of life
    pedestrians always walkong fast     unwilling to stop
    
    don't confronted with overwhelming pressure
    don't have to deal with the high pressure resulted from walking and living
    much comfortable
```
Compared to living in a city, I would like to live in the countryside. The reasons are as below. Firstly, living in the countryside means we can appreciate the healthier environment. Nowadays, people living in city have to suffer the air and water pollution caused by the high speeding development of industry. Secondly, we can enjoy the slow pace of life in the countryside. In big cities, pedestrians are always walking fast and it seems like they would feel unwilling to stop. But with the easy life style of countryside, they don’t have to deal with the high pressure resulted from working and living. So it’ll be much more comfortable to live there. That’s why I prefer to live in the countryside.


**Some people believe it is important for university to provide funding for student entertainment, such as movies or concerts on campus. Others believe that university money should only be used for academic purposes. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.**

```txt
first
really stressful
preoccupied with academic studies   confronted with overwhelming pressure
movies and concerts and help them get some relaxation
better focus on future studies
improve the efficiency to a large extent

second
healthier to spend leisure time doing such entertaining thins
stay at dorm    hang out in the library   -> boring
hold some interesting events  ->  goog way to kill time
```


In my opinion, the money should be used in entertainment rather than academic purpose. The reasons are as below. To start, college life can be really stressful, students have so many classes and assignments each day, so a little movies or concerts can do a lot good to them. Help them easy up and remain a better mood. So it’s a good way to balance their study and life. Furthermore, it’ll be healthier to spend their leisure time doing such entertaining things, otherwise, they may stay at their dorm or hang out in the library, which is a little boring, and if the university can hold some interesting events, it’ll be a good way to kill time.


**Some people think that materials printed on paper, such as books and newspapers, will one day be replaced by electronic versions of those materials. Others believe that printed materials will always be popular. Which point of view do you agree with? Explain why.**
```txt
books and newspapers will be replaced
resources & energy saving
first
    the decreasing of the paper demand-> inhibate the decay of the forest & use less energy during the process
second
    convenient to reproduce the information with low cost and high speed
    store the book file in the cloud server
    using triple backup and remote disaster recovery
```
I agree with the statement that materials printed on paper, such as books and newspapers will one day be replaced by electronic versions of those materials. As for why, I suppose there are two reasons. First, it's more energy and resources saving to use electronic version. The decreasing of the paper demand will inhibate the persistent decay of the forest. And the energy cost during the producing will be decreased. Second, it's convenient to reproduce the information with low cost and high speed. And we could store the book files in the cloud server using triple backup and remote diaster recovery. It's safe and conveinient. Based the reasons above. I think the electronic version of books will have a better future.


**If you were given the choice of a school or work assignment, would you prefer to write a long report or give a speech in front of a large group of people? Use details and examples to explain your choice.**

```txt
first:
recite my words lots of times practice repeatedly
tend to forget what i want to say when I'm standing on the stage

writing a long report -> learn more knowledge about the details
research a lot  and creafully organize my paper

choose a long report as my assignment
```

I would rather to choose the long report rather than a speech. One reason is as for me, I don’t like speak in public. Speaking in public means I have to recite my words lots of time and practice repeatedly for I’m afraid to forget what I want to say when I’m standing on the stage. Second reason is I think writing a long report will help me learn more knowledge than just prepare a speech. To finish a report I need to research a lot and carefully organize my paper. So I will choose a long report as my assignment. 

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?It is more enjoyable for students to read works of fiction (such as novels and stories) than nonfiction. Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.**

```txt
first
    form relevant pictures in their mind
    The Great Gatsby,  necessary for them to shape the luxury situation of Gatsby's mansion
second
    learn some useful narrative techniques
    can learn the method of flashbacks and use it in their own creation
    
more enjoybale for students to read fiction

```

I agree with the statement that it is more enjoyable for students to read fiction than nonfiction. One reason is when students are reading fiction stories, they will form relevant pictures in their mind. For example, when they are reading The Great Gatsby, it is necessary for them to shape the luxury situation of Gatsby’s mansion. Second reason is reading fictions can help students to learn some useful narrative techniques. For example students can learn the method of flashbacks and use it in their own creation. This is why I think it is more enjoyable for students to read fiction.



**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students will learn more if the teachers is kind and friendly. Use specific examples and details to support opinion.**

```txt
first
    kind teacher -> gain student's love and respect
    as the old saying goes    love me, love my dog
    be willing to listen to the teachers they like in class
second
    faced with difficult questions
    more likely to ask teachers they consider nice to them
    if regard one teacher as a strict and bad-tempered person
    avoid asking him questions

    so -> conclusion
```


I agree that students will learn more if teachers are kind and friendly. First, kind teachers will gain students’ love and respect. Just as the old saying goes: “Love me, love my dog.” Students will be more willing to listen to the teachers they like in class. Second, when students are faced with difficult questions, they are more likely to ask teachers they consider nice to them. If they regard one teacher as a strict and bad-tempered person, they will avoid asking him questions. So kind and friendly teachers can actually help students to learn more knowledge.
