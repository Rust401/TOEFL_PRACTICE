Question
**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Use details and examples to explain your answer. All children should be required to learn a second language in school.**

Foreign Language:
* better work oppurtunity
* trend to study

No Foreign Language:
* children don't like it
* just tool, if no require, no need to learn

I don't agree the statement that all children should be required to learn a second language. As for why, I suppose that there are two reasons. First, some children just don't like learn foreign languege. In this case, if they are required to learn a second languge mandatorily, they will be reluctant and don't treat it seriously. They should do something they really like and they really have talent. For example, some of my classmates love playing basketball and have become professional basketball players. So for them learning a second language could be a time-consuming but low margin benefit thing. Second, languges are tools used to communicate. It's no need to learn a skill that will never be used. Some of my frineds work as local bank clerks that have no opportunity to communicate with clients using another language. So it's dispensable for them to learn a second language.


**The woman expresses her opinion about the collegeâ€™s plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.**   

The college plans to renovate its domitory to reverse the trend that more and more students tend to choose off-campus house to living. The woman doesn't agree that. She give two reasons. First, the process of renovating will produce huge noise. And the disgusting noise is unfriendly to the students living in the in-campus doms when they need rest. And they will tend to move to off-campus house to escape the annoyed noise. Second, the college plan to increase the accommodation fee to cover the cost used for renovating. So that's will cause more students who are price sensitive to move out of the campus. They tend to rent a house with low price that they can afford.


**Explain why Henry Darger is considered an Outsider Artist.**  

Outsider artist has two attributes. First, they live isolated with other artists. Henry Darger lived in a small apartment in Chicago. He had no friends and had no social activity. So he was a isolated man. Second, outsider airtists don't accept convential art training, they use their uique way to express their arts. Henry Darger didn't accpet professional art training. In one of his master piece, he use the children cut down from the newspaper to depict the children he have no ability to draw. And he used the similar way to express istance that he is not skillable to create. And his picture is nine-feet long that much bigger than conventional artists' works. So with these two attributes, the Henry Darger is sonsidered an outsider artist.


**The students discussed a problem and two possible solutions. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why.**   

The man apply a summer reasearch but he miss the deadline for recommodation apply. He has two feasible choices. First he could live with his parents who live in a town that need two hour drive. The second choice is that he could rent a house near the campus to save the time on the road. I prefer the second way, to rent a house near the campus. I have two reasons. First, living with his parents is too time-consuming, he need two spend 4 hours per day to go back-and-forth. He may be too tired and has no energy to concentrate on his study. Besides, driving is a high-risk transportation. More time he stays on the car, the less the rate that he suffers no traffic accident. So in this case, it's obviously a better choice to rent a house near the campus and concentrate on his summer reasearch.


`reference:`  
First of all, renting an apartment is what most students do when they could not find a chance to live in a dorm, and for the man, it could save him gas fee for reference books or better food. Secondly, renting an apartment always means one could choose roommate for his or her own preference, especially finding someone who shares almost the same living habits And I am sure the man would like to live with someone he really gets along well with. So I think finding an apartment is a better option. 


**Using the points and examples from the lecture, explain what unity and contrast are and how they make interior design more effective.**  
There're two principles for balance in interior design, one is unity, another is contrast. Unity means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker shady green for the sofa and complement with a matching green in the rug. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistence. However, if you have too much unity in a room, it'll become boring. So you need some contrast to break up that unity, to make your room livelier. For example, you can put bright red cushions on the green sofa, so that the green appears greener next to the red. But you should be careful because too much contrast probably will also destroy the balance by making the room seem busy.


Okay so that is all I have for you guys today and I hope you guys learned something useful.
