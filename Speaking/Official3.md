Question
**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Use details and examples to explain your answer. All children should be required to learn a second language in school.**

Foreign Language:
* better work oppurtunity
* trend to study

No Foreign Language:
* children don't like it
* just tool, if no require, no need to learn

I don't agree the statement that all children should be required to learn a second language. As for why, I suppose that there are two reasons. First, some children just don't like learn foreign languege. In this case, if they are required to learn a second languge mandatorily, they will be reluctant and don't treat it seriously. They should do something they really like and they really have talent. For example, some of my classmates love playing basketball and have become professional basketball players. So for them learning a second language could be a time-consuming but low margin benefit thing. Second, languges are tools used to communicate. It's no need to learn a skill that will never be used. Some of my frineds work as local bank clerks that have no opportunity to communicate with clients using another language. So it's dispensable for them to learn a second language.


**The woman expresses her opinion about the collegeâ€™s plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.**   

The college plans to renovate its domitory to reverse the trend that more and more students tend to choose off-campus house to living. The woman doesn't agree that. She give two reasons. First, the process of renovating will produce huge noise. And the disgusting noise is unfriendly to the students living in the in-campus doms when they need rest. And they will tend to move to off-campus house to escape the annoyed noise. Second, the college plan to increase the accommodation fee to cover the cost used for renovating. So that's will cause more students who are price sensitive to move out of the campus. They tend to rent a house with low price that they can afford.


**Explain why Henry Darger is considered an Outsider Artist.**  

Outsider artist has two attributes. First, they live isolated with other artists. Henry Darger lived in a small apartment in Chicago. He had no friends and had no social activity. So he was a isolated man. Second, outsider airtists don't accept convential art training, they use their uique way to express their arts. Henry Darger didn't accpet professional art training. In one of his master piece, he use the children cut down from the newspaper to depict the children he have no ability to draw. And he used the similar way to express istance that he is not skillable to create. And his picture is nine-feet long that much bigger than conventional artists' works. So with these two attributes, the Henry Darger is sonsidered an outsider artist.


**Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.**   

The man face the problem that he need to get the credit of two courses this semster to get the literature degree, but the two courses conflict with each other in his scheduler. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: first he could do an independent study to fulfill the requirement with the permission and the help of the professor. And second, he could try the same course in another university. I prefer the first one. Firstly, independent study is an indispensible way of study in college life and has essentially no difference from class study, especially with the help and permission with the professor. The man could also use the notes from students in class and do all the assignment by himself, which will promote his efficency and it's time-saving. When he's got any question he could just go staright to the professor on office hour to get the solution. So I choose the first solution. Cuz as it's a good opportunity to learn something by himself. And it's more time-saving and energy friendly. Besides, no more formalities are required to credit exchange.


**Using the points and examples from the lecture, explain the two pricing strategies described by the professor.**  
There are two strategies that companies set the initial price of their product. If the product in novel and there are only a few competitors on market. The initial price will be set to a high value. Analysis from the consumers' view, high price means high quality. And the willing to pay for the new technology with good quality. Hence the companies will get considerable profit. But if the product is not that novel and there have been a lot of companies to save the product. The initial price will set with a low number to attract some price-sensitive customers and hence the companies can get their own consumer group.

There're two types of strategies companies use to set initial price for their product. The first one is to set the initial price high in order to create a high-end image for its product and lower it later. Because the products of high price are often assumed to be of high quality, the company can profit from the people who are willing to pay the high price despite the awareness that it'll come down later. Another strategy is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors, and this strategy is usually adopted in the market that is saturated with the products. For example, a computer company may sell its computers at an affordable price to attract customers who don't have plans for a computer or to persuade those with one to switch brand. Even with the low price, the company still manages to make profit by encouraging its customers to buy the accessories from the same company.
