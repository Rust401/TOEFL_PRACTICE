**What do you miss most about your home when you are away? Use specific details in your explanation.**


When talk about the things I miss most when I am away home. The very first one coming to my mind is the music. As for why, I suppose that's because I have a complete set of audio equipment in my house, including amplifier, stereo and high quality audio cable. And I like the beat and melodies they produce. To be more specific, as a college student, I am always preoccupied with my academic study. In this case, I'm just confronted with overwhelming pressure. By enjoying the music in my home, I can get some relaxation and better focus on my future study as well, thereby improving my study efficiency to a larger extent.


**Many universities now offer academic courses over the Internet. However, some people still prefer learning in traditional classrooms. Which do you think is better? Explain why.**

online:
* speed and learing process
* adjustable time and place
* high density of knowledge
* easy to access

traditional:
* classmates with the same level
* deeper understanding of the problem
* ask the the teacher more details (interaction)
* mandatory

When talk about the online teaching and traditional teaching, the debate has never stop. But I prefer learing in traditional classroom. As for why, I suppose that's mainly because the interactivity and mandatory. To be more specific, by learning in the traditional classroom, I can interact with teachers directly. When I am confused on some knowledge point, I could just raise up my hand to express my confusing and get the teacher's reply. But I could only input the keywords in the search engine to find something I really need if I attend an Internet course. Besides, the tradtional course has a fixed timetable and requires students to attend on time. Students can complete their studies and assignments under the guidence of the timetable. This will allviate the students' burden because they have no need to re arrange their timetable. In summary, I prefer the traditional teaching.


**The computer department is considering a scheduling change. Explain the man’s opinion of the change and the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.**  
The man is strongly against the changing plan for two reasons. First, he insists that the students are busy at night because they will spend time on jobs, families and other activities. So they wouldn't be able to make good use of the addtional classes anyway. Second, he believes hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later is a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced and it's surely cheaper to invest in compters. More importantly that there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees the plan for the reasons stated above.

**Explain how the examples from the professor’s lecture illustrate the relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication.**  
When face-to-face communication happens, the non-verbal message such as our tones and gestures usually communicate as much as or even more than our verbal message, our words. That's is, when our non-verbal message agree with our verbal message, the emotion we want to express wll be enhanced. The professor uses a example to express that. Once his favorite uncle gave him a suprising visit, he told his uncle that he is very happy. And meanwhile his eyes got widely open and he broke into a huge smile and even jump up and down like a little boy. So his uncle felt really good about that. However, when our non-verbal message conflict with our verbal message, it can communicate more message than our words. For instance, when the professor told his daughter how to use hammer and nails, he hurt his fingers. Though he told his daughter that he is ok but his voice trembled and he kept shaking his hand to relief the pain, his daughter didn't believe him. The behavior indicated that he was in pain actually.


**The speakers discussed two possible solutions to the man’s problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why.**  
The man's problem is that he is the fresh student and didn't know where the class is cuz he left his sheduler in the dorm. The women give him two feasible solutions. First, she suggusted him to use the computer to find the the classroom he needs precisly. And second he could just directly go to the lecture hall to ask the professors to check if he arrived the right classroom. I prefer the first one for two reasons. First, the student center is not far from his dorm and he could get the precise information from the compter. If he hurries he will just be one time. Second, directly to the lecture hall to find the right classroom would be rude and abrupt. And the right room could be the last room, and in this case he will be late. So I agree the suggestion that the dude should go to the student center to check the computer.


**Using points and examples from the lecture, explain the importance of visual elements in painting.**  
The artists usually combine or manipulate some visual elements like colors and texture to convey a message or create a mood for an art work. According to the professor, one of this is the use of color. Colors appeal in different ways to the senses and thus can convey/communicate meanings, so artists use different colors to evoke different emotions. For example, red is a strong color, and artists thus use it to evoke strong emotions like anger and excitement, while blue, a cool color, has a calming effect on people. The other is the texture of a painting, an visual illusion created by the artists like roughness or softness. This can also evoke different emotions. Roughness stimulates stronger emotion, while smoothness the other way round. When artists combine these two elements together, they can create a painting that expresses wilder and more chaotic emotions by using red, orange as well as wide sweeping brushstrokes, or they can create a cooler painting with pale colors like blue and soft brush strokes. 

Okay so that is all I have for you guys today and I hope you guys learned something useful.
