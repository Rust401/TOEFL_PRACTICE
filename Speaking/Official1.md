**What do you miss most about your home when you are away? Use specific details in your explanation.**


When talk about the things I miss most when I am away home. The very first one coming to my mind is the music. As for why, I suppose that's because I have a complete set of audio equipment in my house, including amplifier, stereo and high quality audio cable. And I like the beat and melodies they produce. To be more specific, as a college student, I am always preoccupied with my academic study. In this case, I'm just confronted with overwhelming pressure. By enjoying the music in my home, I can get some relaxation and better focus on my future study as well, thereby improving my study efficiency to a larger extent.


**Many universities now offer academic courses over the Internet. However, some people still prefer learning in traditional classrooms. Which do you think is better? Explain why.**

online:
* speed and learing process
* adjustable time and place
* high density of knowledge
* easy to access

traditional:
* classmates with the same level
* deeper understanding of the problem
* ask the the teacher more details (interaction)
* mandatory

When talk about the online teaching and traditional teaching, the debate has never stop. But I prefer learing in traditional classroom. As for why, I suppose that's mainly because the interactivity and mandatory. To be more specific, by learning in the traditional classroom, I can interact with teachers directly. When I am confused on some knowledge point, I could just raise up my hand to express my confusing and get the teacher's reply. But I could only input the keywords in the search engine to find something I really need if I attend an Internet course. Besides, the tradtional course has a fixed timetable and requires students to attend on time. Students can complete their studies and assignments under the guidence of the timetable. This will allviate the students' burden because they have no need to re arrange their timetable. In summary, I prefer the traditional teaching.
