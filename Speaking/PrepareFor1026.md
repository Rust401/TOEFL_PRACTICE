1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is easier to be an adult than to be a child.

I diasgree the statement that is's easier to be an adult than to be a child. As for why, I suppose that there are two reasons. On the one hand, children are taken good care of both by parents and grandparents. They don't have to worry about how to make a living. After all, they are not the breadwinners. So they are free from anxiety and pressure. On the other hand, they can enjoy pure and pristine friendship with their little buddies who just live next door to them. There are much less competition, comparison or peer pressure among little kids. They are loved, cherished, or even pampered. Childhood really seem like to be a peaceful and joyful time where they will not bothered by the trival and mandane things that keep bugging adolescents and adults
