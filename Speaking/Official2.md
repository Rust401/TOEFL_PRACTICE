Question
**Talk about a time a friend or a family member helped you in the past. Describe how the person helped you then explain why this was important to you.**

When talk about this topic, the very first one comming to my mind is my friend Qinye Tang, who working at a hedge fund. As for why, I suppose that's because he is intelligent and  helped me build a set of logic to solve the problems. To be more specific, before I met him, I was just a coach potato who binge watching TV on the sofa. I can hardly solve the problem I have not encountered and all I can do is ask the teacher for help. Once I have an programming assignment about the link list and I can't even write one line code. He demonstrated his solution from the idea to the implemention and I could learn to solve the problem step by step. After that, I learnd how to solve problems with my own strength. I am honored to have such a friend.

**Some people enjoy taking risk and trying new things, others are not adventurous, they are cautious and try to avoid danger. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why.**

risk:
* tend to get more profit
* handle specific situation and scene
* diversity life
* tend to learn new thins

non-risk:
* no tendency to be hurt
* stable property
* easy life
* more energy to a specific region

I prefer to take risks and try new things. As for why, I suppose that's because taking risks is a way to improve oneself, a way to broaden one's horizon. Take the Columbia for example. If he hadn't take risks to west, the new continent may not be discoverd. The new crops we are familiar with now which were planted in the western continent will not be brought back. Besides, trying new things is a good way to learn new skills. I was a boring couch potato who binge watching TV series on the sofa before. I hated to read new books or even watch new movie. Then I decided to dirve myself out of the comfort zone and try some movies. And I'm fortuinate that I gained some new problem-solving skills and learnd some novel perspective. By enjoying that, I can get some relaxation and better focus on my future study as well, thereby improving my study efficiency to a large extent. So I prefer to take risks and try new things.


**The man expresses his opinion about the universityâ€™s plan. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.**   

The university plan to play classic music in the cafeteria during the lunch time to promote students to take off their headphones and concenctrate more on communicating with their friends and get some relaxtion. The man disagree that. First, he think students tend to study during the lunch time especially when they have comming-up exams or some soon-due assignment. And the broadcasting music is destracting and they can't concentrate on their study. Second, most students don't like classic music and they tend to plug in their mp3 and listen to their own preference to avoid the broadcast classic music and stuff like that.


**Using the example of the Peanut Bug and the morpho butterfly, explain the concept of revealing coloration.**  

Many animals use sudden revealing their body color to protect themselves from attacking. There are two examples. The first is Peanut Bug, which has colored front wings so they blend in with environment. But its back wings have bright colorful spots on them. Usually the back wings are closed and hidden. Once the bugs are attacked. They pop out the back wing and realving the colorful spot. The predators may be surprised and the peanut bug can run away. Another example is the morpho butterfly which has special wings whose shiny part are hidden when it's resting. So when face the attacking, the butterfiles take off. The light reflect from the special part of their wings blocks the birds' sight and this can prevent the predators following the morpho bufferfly.


**Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.**   

The man face the problem that he need to get the credit of two courses this semster to get the literature degree, but the two courses conflict with each other in his scheduler. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the man: first he could do an independent study to fulfill the requirement with the permission and the help of the professor. And second, he could try the same course in another university. I prefer the first one. Firstly, independent study is an indispensible way of study in college life and has essentially no difference from class study, especially with the help and permission with the professor. The man could also use the notes from students in class and do all the assignment by himself, which will promote his efficency and it's time-saving. When he's got any question he could just go staright to the professor on office hour to get the solution. So I choose the first solution. Cuz as it's a good opportunity to learn something by himself. And it's more time-saving and energy friendly. Besides, no more formalities are required to credit exchange.


**Using the points and examples from the lecture, explain the two pricing strategies described by the professor.**  
There are two strategies that companies set the initial price of their product. If the product in novel and there are only a few competitors on market. The initial price will be set to a high value. Analysis from the consumers' view, high price means high quality. And the willing to pay for the new technology with good quality. Hence the companies will get considerable profit. But if the product is not that novel and there have been a lot of companies to save the product. The initial price will set with a low number to attract some price-sensitive customers and hence the companies can get their own consumer group.

There're two types of strategies companies use to set initial price for their product. The first one is to set the initial price high in order to create a high-end image for its product and lower it later. Because the products of high price are often assumed to be of high quality, the company can profit from the people who are willing to pay the high price despite the awareness that it'll come down later. Another strategy is to set the initial price low to undercut competitors, and this strategy is usually adopted in the market that is saturated with the products. For example, a computer company may sell its computers at an affordable price to attract customers who don't have plans for a computer or to persuade those with one to switch brand. Even with the low price, the company still manages to make profit by encouraging its customers to buy the accessories from the same company.


Okay so that is all I have for you guys today and I hope you guys learned something useful.

* In my observation, many of my friends have become couch potatoes who binge watching TV series on the sofa.
