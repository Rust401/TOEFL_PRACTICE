Question
**Talk about a time a friend or a family member helped you in the past. Describe how the person helped you then explain why this was important to you.**

When talk about this topic, the very first one comming to my mind is my friend Qinye Tang, who working at a hedge fund. As for why, I suppose that's because he is intelligent and  helped me build a set of logic to solve the problems. To be more specific, before I met him, I was just a coach potato who binge watching TV on the sofa. I can hardly solve the problem I have not encountered and all I can do is ask the teacher for help. Once I have an programming assignment about the link list and I can't even write one line code. He demonstrated his solution from the idea to the implemention and I could learn to solve the problem step by step. After that, I learnd how to solve problems with my own strength. I am honored to have such a friend.

**Some people enjoy taking risk and trying new things, others are not adventurous, they are cautious and try to avoid danger. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why.**

risk:
* tend to get more profit
* handle specific situation and scene
* diversity life
* tend to learn new thins

non-risk:
* no tendency to be hurt
* stable property
* easy life
* more energy to a specific region

I prefer to take risks and try new things. As for why, I suppose that's because taking risks is a way to improve oneself, a way to broaden one's horizon. Take the Columbia for example. If he hadn't take risks to west, the new continent may not be discoverd. The new crops we are familiar with now which were planted in the western continent will not be brought back. Besides, trying new things is a good way to learn new skills. I was a boring couch potato who binge watching TV series on the sofa before. I hated to read new books or even watch new movie. Then I decided to dirve myself out of the comfort zone and try some movies. And I'm fortuinate that I gained some new problem-solving skills and learnd some novel perspective. By enjoying that, I can get some relaxation and better focus on my future study as well, thereby improving my study efficiency to a large extent. So I prefer to take risks and try new things.


**The computer department is considering a scheduling change. Explain the man’s opinion of the change and the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.**  
The man is strongly against the changing plan for two reasons. First, he insists that the students are busy at night because they will spend time on jobs, families and other activities. So they wouldn't be able to make good use of the addtional classes anyway. Second, he believes hiring more teachers to keep the academic building open later is a bad idea. Since the computer prices have been reduced and it's surely cheaper to invest in compters. More importantly that there is enough space in the building for holding more computers. So the man disagrees the plan for the reasons stated above.

**Explain how the examples from the professor’s lecture illustrate the relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication.**  
When face-to-face communication happens, the non-verbal message such as our tones and gestures usually communicate as much as or even more than our verbal message, our words. That's is, when our non-verbal message agree with our verbal message, the emotion we want to express wll be enhanced. The professor uses a example to express that. Once his favorite uncle gave him a suprising visit, he told his uncle that he is very happy. And meanwhile his eyes got widely open and he broke into a huge smile and even jump up and down like a little boy. So his uncle felt really good about that. However, when our non-verbal message conflict with our verbal message, it can communicate more message than our words. For instance, when the professor told his daughter how to use hammer and nails, he hurt his fingers. Though he told his daughter that he is ok but his voice trembled and he kept shaking his hand to relief the pain, his daughter didn't believe him. The behavior indicated that he was in pain actually.


**The speakers discussed two possible solutions to the man’s problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why.**  
The man's problem is that he is the fresh student and didn't know where the class is cuz he left his sheduler in the dorm. The women give him two feasible solutions. First, she suggusted him to use the computer to find the the classroom he needs precisly. And second he could just directly go to the lecture hall to ask the professors to check if he arrived the right classroom. I prefer the first one for two reasons. First, the student center is not far from his dorm and he could get the precise information from the compter. If he hurries he will just be one time. Second, directly to the lecture hall to find the right classroom would be rude and abrupt. And the right room could be the last room, and in this case he will be late. So I agree the suggestion that the dude should go to the student center to check the computer.


**Using points and examples from the lecture, explain the importance of visual elements in painting.**  
The artists usually combine or manipulate some visual elements like colors and texture to convey a message or create a mood for an art work. According to the professor, one of this is the use of color. Colors appeal in different ways to the senses and thus can convey/communicate meanings, so artists use different colors to evoke different emotions. For example, red is a strong color, and artists thus use it to evoke strong emotions like anger and excitement, while blue, a cool color, has a calming effect on people. The other is the texture of a painting, an visual illusion created by the artists like roughness or softness. This can also evoke different emotions. Roughness stimulates stronger emotion, while smoothness the other way round. When artists combine these two elements together, they can create a painting that expresses wilder and more chaotic emotions by using red, orange as well as wide sweeping brushstrokes, or they can create a cooler painting with pale colors like blue and soft brush strokes. 

Okay so that is all I have for you guys today and I hope you guys learned something useful.

* In my observation, many of my friends have become couch potatoes who binge watching TV series on the sofa.
