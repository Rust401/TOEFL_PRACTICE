**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is important to remember and learn from the past. Use details and examples to explain your opinion.**

__+:__
* some experince to avoid mistake
* get the shortest path

__-:__
* stuck in the past and can't keep with
* time-consuming to make a summary

I agree with the statement that is's important to remember and learn from the past. As for why, I suppose that's because we could get some experince from the past to avoid mistakes. When I was a young boy, I was disputed to a task conducted by a group to develope a image-processing program. I was mainly responsible for the core backend module. But I had poor communication with my group mates and the result was that our project failed due to the incompatibable of our interface. I made a summary of my mistakes and decided to improve my communication skills. Subsequent projects completed very smoothly. We managed to get the easy but high-efficent way to coding and exchange opinion. So learning from the past is so important.


**The man expresses his opinion about the proposal in the student’s letter. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state the man’s opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.**

The man doesn't support the suggestions in the studdent's letter to pave the dirt trail with cement to make it safer and nicer. First, he doesn't think paving the trail will make it safer for the user. Because the paving will make the surface of the track harder and it may produce damage when peole run on a hard surface. And he also said that the paving will not make the track nicer, because people running on the track are generally in the purples of put themselves into a natrual environment to get some relaxation. And paving will make the track similar to a regular street. And it will attract less people who have the urgent need of get relaxation. So based on the reasons above the man doesn't support the proposal.


**Explain how the example from the professor’s lecture illustrates the experimenter effect.**

Experimenter effect means a phenomenon that the reasearch will change their behavior to the experiment to acuquire the result fit the information they were told before the experiment. The lecture illustrates a case. A researcher are told to training two group of monkey to learn to pick up an object and record the time of the average successful picking. Although there's no difference between the two groups of monkeys, the researcher are told that one group's intelligent is higher than the other group. And the reasearch change his way of training by give the so callled high-intelligent monkey more courage and patient. And the result is that the group of monkeys marked with the label of high-intelligent spend 2 hours less than the normal group of monkeys on average. That's the case of experimenter effect.




When the researchers expect certain result during their experiment, the expectations usually affect the outcome. This phenomenon is called experimenter effect. The professor illustrates this with a monkey experiment that he read about. In the experiment, a researcher was given two groups of monkey and asked to teach them to pick up a ball and put it in a box. And he had been told that one group was smarter than the other, which was not true. Therefore, anyway, the researcher expected that the smarter group was easier to train. And it took two hours less time to train the supposedly smarter monkey because he tried to communicate with them, frequently smiled at them, encouraged them, and talked to them. While with the other group, he was not that enthusiastic. So actually it's the researcher's behavior that influenced the result. That's how experimenter effect is achieved during the experiment.


**Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.**

The women supposed to wear white shirt and black pants to stay the same with her choir member in a concert. But there's a huge stain on her white shirt and there's no time for her to buy a shirt from the shop. She had two solutions. The first is that she could wear another shirt of her own but the color is not that white. The second is that she could borrow a shirt from her roommate who is away now. I recommend the second choice. What a choir needs for concert is not only perfect performance of their instruments but also perfect costumes, and obviously a similar colored shirt will ruin all that visual perfection. Second, since white shirts are common and simple outfits for students, and her roommate wouldn't mind, the woman really has nothing to concern about. In a nut shell, I believe the woman should ask her roommate for help.


**Using the examples of the eel and the angler fish, explain two types of adaptations that help animals survive in the deepest parts of the ocean.**  
Because the deeper part of the ocean is cold and dark, food source there is scarce, so deep sea organisms develop some adaptations to survive. For example, many organisms have physical features that help them to eat preys that are bigger even than them selves, like a kind of eel. The eel has a huge mouth and a large stomach that can expand, so it can eat a large prey that turns into plenty of energy and nutrition to help it sustain for quite a while, before it needs to eat again. Another is the ability to generate light that can be used to capture prey. For example, angler fish has a light-generating structure on its head that is close to its mouth. And when it glows in the dark, other organisms may assume it's something to eat and are therefore attracted by it. But when they get close enough, the angler fish will catch and eat them.
